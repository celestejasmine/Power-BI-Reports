# Power-BI-Reports
This repository serves as a portfolio presenting my Power BI report projects.

## Data Professional Survey
For this project, I worked with an online Data Professional Survey. The data was obtained at this [link](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx). I first did some data exploration and cleaning in Excel, editing user inputs, reformatting data, getting some basic statistics. I also defined some questions of interest to explore in the data visualization. I then imported the data into Power BI and made some further cleaning in Power Query and added new data columns as necessary. Afterwards, I worked on making a four page dashboard. The report is designed with an overview page, then three more focused analysis pages showing visualizations related to questions on Position, Sex, and Industry.

The full 4 page report can be seen [here](https://github.com/celestejasmine/Power-BI-Reports/blob/main/Data%20Professional%20Survey%20-%20Power%20BI%20Report.pdf) as a pdf. The first page is shown below.

# Power-BI-Reports
A portfolio presenting my Power BI report projects.

## Data Professional Survey
For this project, I worked with an online Data Professional Survey. The data was obtained at this [link](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx). I first did some data exploration and cleaning in Excel, editing user inputs, reformatting data, getting some basic statistics. I also defined some questions of interest to explore in the data visualization. I then imported it into Power BI and made some further cleaning in Power Query and added new data columns as necessary. Afterwards, I worked on making a four page dashboard. The report is designed with an overview page, then three more focused analysis pages showing visualizations related to questions on Position, Sex, and Industry.

The final report can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CUA_A3zdatm_NutqVdXloP7kNfMstJ2f/view?usp=sharing) as a pdf.
